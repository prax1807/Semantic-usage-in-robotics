# Problem Statement
Semantic descriptions to navigate around in a webot designed map
# What this project aims to solve
Robotics is generalised as physical task performing machines are advanced enough to successfully perform the tasks they are coded for. The question of further research looks at abilities to improving these functionalities or diversifying them. This paper focuses on diversifying the aspect of task performed with reference to descriptors given prior the robots working. 
Task at hand includes environment traversal inside described house and fetching objects located at various locations all over the house. This all is carried out with the aim to guide the robot on taking a particular route with restrictions of travelling across certain rooms and alternatively take different paths.

# Working of the project
We run the virtual dataset used in ANNABELL as an input to the webots project that takes inputs of direction moving the robot to the inputed direction from ANNABELL. The input is analysed in a way to find the straight path to designated coordinate using compass and gps. The path algoeithm spins the the robot to get the right heading which then moves forward on finising the right heading. With achieved traversal we also use lidar imaging to avoid obstacles.
